# cosine_similarty_between_n_documents_-without-using-libraries
This is a program to find the cosine similarity between n documents.
these n documents are taken from a single document(each line of this single document is treated as a document)
cosine similarity will give a value beteen 0 and 1.
if the value is near to 0 then the documents are very DISSIMILAR.
if the value is near to 1 then the documents are very SIMILAR.
